### Tech

Memory Game uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Microsoft Code] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps


And of course Memory Game itself is open source with a Memory Game repo
 on GitHub.
